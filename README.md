## Installation

The translation is installed like any mod. It is prepared to be placed directly into your Modules folder manually or with Vortex.

## Requirement

You must first download the latest version of Bannerlord AutoTrader.

## Known issues

* There are two lines that could not be translated in the settings due to potentially errors in the definition of some IDs in the original mod. This has been reported to the author and maybe it will be fixed later!
* The mod is written for QWERTY keyboards. I have switched the texts to match with the AZERTY keys. So if you use a QWERTY keyboard, consider that you will have to press ALT + A to open the settings menu!

Don't hesitate to contribute and use "Issues" tab!
